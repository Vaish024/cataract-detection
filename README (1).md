# Cataract-Scanner-Py

A Python-powered tool to accurately identify and annotate the pupil in eye images and detect signs of early cataract.

## Overview

This script utilizes OpenCV's computer vision algorithms to detect and annotate the pupil in ocular images, facilitating the assessment of cataract symptoms.

## Research Publication

For a detailed technical analysis and the methodologies behind this script, refer to our IEEE publication:

[**Automated detection of eye diseases**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7566355)


## Sample Images

Below are some sample outputs of our cataract detection:

 <img src="images/sample.jpg" width="300">  <img src="images/sample2.jpg" width="300"> 

 <img src="images/sample4.png" width="500">  <img src="images/sample5.png" width="500">
